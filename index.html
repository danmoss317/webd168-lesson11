                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I was born on St. Patrick's Day in 1989, and grew up in the city of Corona in Southern California. I spent the first 26 years of my life there before moving to Riverside, California. After seven months, I moved to San Diego in 2016 and still reside here today.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, watching sports, riding my bicycle, golfing, and spending time with my girlfriend, family, and friends. I enjoy all kinds of different music, but one of my favorite things to do is to switch on the lava lamp and throw on a classic rock record. The video game I play the most right now is Rocket League on Xbox, but it's not uncommon for me to fire up the old Nintendo and get down on some 8-bit side-scrolling action. My favorite sport to watch is football, but I also enjoy basketball and soccer. My favorite football team is the Denver Broncos, for basketball I root for the Portland Trail Blazers, and the US National Team is my favorite when it comes to soccer.</p>

                    <h3>A Few Favorite Classic Rock Bands</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bad Company</li>
                        <li>Electric Light Orchestra</li>
                        <li>The Police</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why am I Taking this Class?</h3>
                    <p>The reason I'm taking this course is to improve upon my HTML and CSS knowledge, and to eventually become a front end web developer. My first taste of HTML was back in the MySpace days when I'd customize my page. I enjoyed tinkering with the code, but never considered making it a career until fairly recently. A couple years ago I started learning HTML and CSS through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">the Odin Project</a>. Now I'm looking to expand on the skills I gained there to reach my goal of becoming a web developer.</p>
